Note: 
The start time is measured from the start of the call until all connections are connected.
However, in the delays.png plot there is a spike at the very start, and it lasts a lot longer
than the average start time we measured, this is likely because at the beginning of the 
program, there is still a lot of initialization work between connections are established 
and actual computation of command.

Also, the average delay is calculated excluding the spike at the start.

Average delay (in secoonds) over about 10s is 0.0811438125
Average start time (in seconds) over 10 runs is 0.11434675
